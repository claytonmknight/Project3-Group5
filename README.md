US Top 10 Cities - Electricity and Weather Data
 
We have found a dataset from July 2018 through May 2020 that contains 
information on the top 10 US cities’ electricity usage and their temperatures.  Our 
idea with this dataset is to see the correlations between a city’s electricity usage 
and their average temperature.  In our visualization, we are intending to display the 
city’s average temperature when comparing what their electricity usage would be 
using a slider bar.  With this heat map we would also have drop-down to select the 
month and year to give you the average temperature during that time of year.
